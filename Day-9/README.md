# Day 9: Loops - for Loop

## Objective:
Master the `for` loop to repeat tasks.

## Topics Covered:

- What is a loop?
- The `for` loop and iterating over sequences (e.g., lists, ranges)
- Using `range()` to generate numbers

## Key Concepts:

- Iterating over lists or sequences
- Using `for` loops to automate repetitive tasks
- The `range()` function for generating sequences of numbers

---
## Code Example:

```python
# Using a for loop to iterate through the list and print each number
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
# Using range to create a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i) 
```
# Task-1:- Print Numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop
# Task-2:- Print Names of Your Friends Using a List and a for loop
