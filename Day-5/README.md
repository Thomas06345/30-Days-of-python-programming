# Day 5

## Task-1:- Palindrome Checker

### Overview

This is a Python program that checks if a given word is a **palindrome**. A palindrome is a word that reads the same forward and backward.

### Example

- **Input**: `"madam"`
  - **Output**: `"madam is a palindrome."`

- **Input**: `"hello"`
  - **Output**: `"hello is not a palindrome."`

### How It Works

1. The program asks the user to enter a word.
2. It checks if the word is the same when read backwards.
3. It then prints whether the word is a palindrome or not.

# Task-2:- Python For Loop Examples

## Overview
A `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, string, or range) and execute a block of code multiple times. The `for` loop is generally used when you know beforehand how many times you want the loop to run.

## Printing a Pattern of Stars

### Problem:
We want to print a triangular pattern of stars (`*`) where the number of stars increases by one with each row.

### *
### **
### ***
### ****
### *****

This output is generated by iterating through rows (from 1 to 5), printing an increasing number of stars (`*`) in each row. The number of stars printed in each row corresponds to the row number.

### Key points:
1. The loop starts with one star and increases by one in each iteration.
2. Each line's number of stars corresponds to the row number (1st row = 1 star, 2nd row = 2 stars, etc.).
